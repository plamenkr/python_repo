number_of_people = int(input())
capacity = int(input())


full_courses = number_of_people // capacity
diff = number_of_people - (full_courses * capacity)
if diff > 0:
    print(full_courses + 1)
else:
    print(full_courses)

another solution is

from math import ceil
number_of_people = int(input())
capacity = int(input())
full_courses = ceil(number_of_people / capacity)
print(full_courses)
